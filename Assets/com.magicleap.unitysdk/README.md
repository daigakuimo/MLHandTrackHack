# Magic Leap Unity SDK

This is the official Magic Leap Unity SDK, which exposes the full Magic Leap device capabilities within the Unity engine. 

Scoped Registry Settings: 
- URL : `https://registry.npmjs.org`
- Scope : `com.magicleap`

This SDK is provided in the form of an npm package, just like Unity's official add-ons. Therefore, integration into your Unity project is as easy as adding our scoped registry to your project settings and using the Unity Package Manager to install. After integration, upgrades and dependencies can also be managed via the Unity Package Manager.
